## Hi there 👋

I'm a Master's student at Sun Yat-sen University, currently diving into the Finite Element Method using the [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) library. I'm also preparing to explore Model Order Reduction techniques in the near future.

🔬 Current Project: Sequential implementation of thermo-mechanical coupling  
📚 Currently Learning: MFEM-based FEM, Model Order Reduction  
🌍 Language Skills: Certified French B2 level  
💡 Interests: Numerical simulation, computational mechanics, high-performance computing  

Feel free to connect or collaborate!
